 This project allows the user to create notes with a title and text. The user is also able to delete notes. The notes also remain persistant on the page even after a refresh. This was created using Express.js. This project taught me how to use .get, .post, and .delete to retrieve data, post data and delete data from a file on a server. This also us the built in library of File System to write to the file. This also use UUID to generate a unique id for each note.
